A firefox extension that blocks access to many LLM providers. 

-----

List of LLMs taken from [this wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_large_language_models) and [this fmhy page](https://fmhy.net/ai). If you know more LLM websites that are not included here, please make a PR and I'll merge it.


However, please note that LLM websites that are primarily research LLMs, such as SciSpace, ‚Å†Bohrium, Scinito, Elicit, etc., are not included in the list.

Current list includes Official Model Sites, Multiple Model Sites, Roleplaying Chatbots, Coding LLMs, LLM Writing Tools and misc.
